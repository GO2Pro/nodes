### **Exploring CrossFi Technology**

#### **What Makes CrossFi Technology Unique?**

CrossFi technology stands out for its ability to extend blockchain's reach, providing users with transparent and accessible financial tools worldwide. The CrossFi App integrates financial services with comprehensive banking features, including debit cards, a non-custodial settlement model, and eliminates intermediaries which are typical in traditional finance within the crypto market. 

**Key offerings of CrossFi technology include:**
- Cross-border transactions independent of Western financial institutions.
- Tokenization of banking services and loyalty programs.
- Fully integrated acquiring solutions with payment cards, POS terminals, and self-service terminals.
- Providing electronic payment instruments and a processing network for ATMs, trading terminals, and e-commerce platforms.

#### **Ensuring Security in CrossFi**

**CrossFi's security is upheld through several measures:**
- It employs a blockchain with a modular Tendermint architecture, using the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol. This setup prevents fraud by blocking nodes transmitting incorrect data during validation.
- The security and legality of XFI, CrossFi's native token, have been validated by Singapore's largest and oldest law firm.
- XFI is listed on prominent crypto exchanges like MEXC and Huobi, ensuring high-performance trading.
- The CrossFi App is certified for compliance with the PCI DSS international security standard, safeguarding customer payment data.

#### **Core Goals and Features of the CrossFi Team**

The primary objective of the CrossFi team is to generate liquidity flow and develop financial products for everyday use of the coin. XFI, the central token, facilitates access to all services in the EVM segment of the blockchain. This includes token creation, account abstraction, anonymous payments, cross-chain transfers, multisig, a console service, and new DeFi products. XFI serves as the primary payment method within the CrossFi App. Additionally, 15% of MPX coin sales contribute to the XFI liquidity pool, with more details available in CrossFi Docs.

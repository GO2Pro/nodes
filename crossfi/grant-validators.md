Incentives for validators in the CrossFi Chain Testnet are primarily designed to ensure uninterrupted and decentralized operation of the blockchain. These incentives play a crucial role in motivating validators to actively participate, secure the network, and maintain its integrity.

The general goals of CrossFi Chain EVM Testnet:

The key eligibility criteria for the Validator Grant Program is being one of the top 64 validators. The rating reflects the total MPX staking amount. But even if you are on the TOP 64 list, it does not guarantee you will receive a grant. During the CrossFi Chain Testnet, validators are required to meet certain criteria in order to participate and contribute to the network's stability and security. This affects the final list of the top 64 throughout the initiative program. Everyone has a chance to rise in the ranking and claim a win. There are 9 main criterias. Check yourself.

### 1. Node functionality, its stability, and minimal block skipping

Validators must ensure that their nodes are fully functional and able to perform all the necessary operations required by the network. Validator nodes need to exhibit high levels of stability to contribute to the overall health of the network. Block skipping refers to a situation where a validator fails to validate and propose blocks consistently. During the CrossFi Chain Testnet, validators are expected to minimize block skipping as much as possible.

### 2. Availability of dedicated infrastructure for the node, aiming for maximum decentralization and special attention to the hardware, specifically ensuring that the node is not deployed on public VPS

Validators are encouraged to have dedicated infrastructure for running their nodes. This means utilizing hardware resources that are exclusively dedicated to the validator node's operation. Decentralization is a fundamental principle of blockchain networks, including testnets. CrossFi Chain Testnet places importance on maximizing decentralization by encouraging validators to operate independently and avoid relying on centralized hosting providers or services. Deploying the validator node on public VPS is discouraged during the CrossFi Chain Testnet. Public VPS providers generally have shared resources, and the performance and security of the node can be compromised due to factors beyond the validator's control.

### 3. Availability of various services such as RPC/API for working with the node and the blockchain

Validators should make RPC available to allow external applications and users to communicate with their nodes. Validators should offer well-documented APIs that allow developers to integrate their applications seamlessly with the network.

### 4. Development of comprehensive documentation for node usage, deployment instructions, and various materials to facilitate blockchain operations

Validators can enhance their documentation efforts by providing additional materials that facilitate blockchain operations. This may include tutorials, examples, code snippets, and best practices for developing smart contracts, interacting with the blockchain through APIs, integrating with external systems, and other related tasks.

### 5. Availability of tools for monitoring validator performance, explorers, and other resources that help transparently interact with the node

Validators should provide monitoring tools that allow users and other stakeholders to track the performance and health of their validator nodes.

### 6. Proper presentation of the node, avatar, contact information, and complete information on rewards and fees

Validators should present their nodes in a professional manner to instill trust and confidence among users and stakeholders. This can involve creating a dedicated website or webpage that provides information about the validator, its mission, and its contributions to the network. Validators should prominently display an avatar or logo that represents their identity within the CrossFi Chain EVM Testnet. Validators should provide clear and comprehensive information about the rewards and fees associated with delegating or staking coins with their node.

### 7. Having your own community and timely communication of various project activities to the community, as well as preparing educational materials for users

Validators should actively engage in building and nurturing their own community of users, supporters, and stakeholders. This can be achieved through various means such as social media channels, dedicated forums, chat groups, or mailing lists.

### 8. Being on the TOP 64 validator list (this criterion can increase your chances of receiving a grant)

This criterion allows you to increase your chances of receiving a grant, but it is not the main criterion.

### 9. Deploying the node in the mainnet and developing it to provide a service

Validators should showcase their capability to deploy their nodes in the mainnet environment. This involves transitioning from the testnet to the live production network, ensuring the stability, security, and reliability of their nodes in a real-world setting.

Thoroughly studying and monitoring the criteria for validators during the CrossFi Chain Testnet is crucial to ensure that all grant applicants meet the established standards. This diligent evaluation process helps maintain the integrity, security, and effectiveness of the network. We believe in you! Join us!
